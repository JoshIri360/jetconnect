# JetConnect
JetConnect is a web application API that allows users to book and manage flight tickets online. The API will be built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack with a microservice architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. JetConnect will be a personal project aimed at increasing my backend development knowledge and enhancing my programming skills.
