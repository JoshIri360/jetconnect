# JetConnect
JetConnect is a web application API that allows users to book and manage flight tickets online. The API will be built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack with a microservice architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. JetConnect will be a personal project aimed at increasing my backend development knowledge and enhancing my programming skills.

## Aim
The aim of JetConnect API is to create an efficient and secure ticket booking system that provides users with a seamless experience. The API will enable users to search for flights, book tickets, view and modify their bookings, and make payments securely.

## Objectives
1. Design a user-friendly interface for the API that simplifies the ticket booking process
2. Develop an efficient backend system that handles user requests, bookings, and payments securely
